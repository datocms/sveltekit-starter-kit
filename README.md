# SvelteKit Starter Kit

This project aims to be a great starting point for your SvelteKit projects that need to interact with DatoCMS.

- 🔍 **Fully commented code** — Every file is commented and explained in detail, it will be impossible to get lost!
- 💯 **100% TypeScript** — Thanks to [gql.tada](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) every GraphQL query is fully typed, and your IDE will help you complete the GraphQL queries.
- 🛠️ **Minimal boilerplate** — The project is minimal and exposes only what is necessary to get started, without complicated models that need to be removed.
- 🚫 **Zero CSS** — There is only one CSS import, which you can remove to use your preferred CSS tool.
- 📝 **Full support for Draft Mode** — Your editors can always view the latest draft version of the content.
- ✏️ **Click-to-edit overlays** — Integrated [@datocms/content-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link) for intuitive content editing. Click on any content element on your website to instantly open the DatoCMS editor for that specific field.
- 🧩 **Plugin ready** — Full integration with the [Web Previews](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews) plugin, including Visual Editing mode for seamless in-context editing, and [SEO/Readability Analysis](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-seo-readability-analysis).
- 🔄 **DatoCMS's Real-time Updates API** — Your editors can see updated content instantly as soon as you save a new version on DatoCMS.
- 🌐 **SEO Metadata** — Full integration between SvelteKit and the SEO settings coming from DatoCMS.
- 📦 Official CDA Client — Uses @datocms/cda-client for performant, type-safe GraphQL queries to the Content Delivery API.
- 🔒 Type-Safe CMA Client — Uses @datocms/cma-client with auto-generated types from your schema for full autocomplete and compile-time safety.

## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fsveltekit-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Read)
- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL`: Your DatoCMS project URL (e.g., `https://your-project.admin.datocms.com`). This enables click-to-edit overlays that link content directly to the DatoCMS editor.

Then set both `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` and `PRIVATE_SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` by generating two different secure strings (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or any other cryptographically-secure random string generator):

- The `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` will be used to safeguard all API routes from incoming requests from untrusted sources;
- The `PRIVATE_SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` will be used to sign the Draft Mode cookies.

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## Click-to-edit overlays

This starter kit includes [@datocms/content-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link), which provides intuitive click-to-edit overlays for your content.

### How to use

When viewing your website in draft mode, **press and hold the Alt/Option key** to enable click-to-edit mode. Interactive overlays will appear on all editable content. Release the key to disable the overlays.

This feature works in two powerful ways:

### 1. Standalone website editing

Click on any content element to instantly open the DatoCMS editor for that specific field in a new tab. This makes it incredibly easy for editors to jump directly to the content they want to modify.

### 2. Web Previews plugin Visual Editing mode

When using the [Web Previews plugin](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews) in Visual Editing mode, clicking on content opens the field editor in a side panel right next to your preview. The integration also enables:

- **In-plugin navigation**: Users can navigate to different URLs within the Visual mode interface (like a browser navigation bar), and the preview automatically updates to show the corresponding page
- **Synchronized state**: The preview and DatoCMS interface stay in perfect sync

This bidirectional communication is established automatically when your preview runs inside the Web Previews plugin—no additional configuration needed.

### How it works

The implementation consists of three parts:

1. **Data fetching** (`src/lib/datocms/queries.ts:43`): When fetching draft content, the `contentLink: 'v1'` option embeds stega-encoded metadata into text fields
2. **ContentLink component** (`src/lib/components/ContentLink/index.svelte`): Creates interactive overlays and handles the Web Previews plugin integration
3. **Layout integration** (`src/routes/+layout.svelte:40`): The ContentLink component is rendered only in draft mode

For more details, see the [package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link).

## VS Code

It is highly recommended to follow [these instructions](https://gql-tada.0no.co/get-started/installation#vscode-setup) for an optimal experience with Visual Studio Code, including features like diagnostics, auto-completions, and type hovers for GraphQL.

## Using the Web Previews Plugin

If you're using this starter kit with the popular [Web Previews plugin](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews), we already include a CORS-ready endpoint for you, so there's very little setup needed.

You don't have to create or edit any files in this repo. Instead, you only need to specify the "Preview webhook URL" in the plugin settings.

If your site is deployed to www.example.com, then the webhook URL should be `https://www.example.com/api/preview-links?token=secretTokenProtectingWebhookEndpointsFromBeingCalledByAnyone`.

That endpoint URL corresponds to the file [src/routes/api/preview-links/+server.ts](src/routes/api/preview-links/+server.ts) in this repo.

The secret token is defined as the env var `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` in [.env.example](.env.example). If you deployed this starter from our marketplace, its default value will be `secretTokenProtectingWebhookEndpointsFromBeingCalledByAnyone`. If you manually deployed it, you'll have to set that token. It can be any URL-safe string as long as the `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` env var and the `token` query parameter both match.
