## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fsveltekit-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `PRIVATE_DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Admin)

Then set both `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` and `PRIVATE_SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` by generating two different secure strings (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or any other cryptographically-secure random string generator):

- The `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` will be used to safeguard all API routes from incoming requests from untrusted sources;
- The `PRIVATE_SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` will be used to sign the Draft Mode cookies.

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## VS Code

It is highly recommended to follow [these instructions](https://gql-tada.0no.co/get-started/installation#vscode-setup) for an optimal experience with Visual Studio Code, including features like diagnostics, auto-completions, and type hovers for GraphQL.

## Using the Web Previews Plugin

If you're using this starter kit with the popular [Web Previews plugin](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews), we already include a CORS-ready endpoint for you, so there's very little setup needed.

You don't have to create or edit any files in this repo. Instead, you only need to specify the "Preview webhook URL" in the plugin settings.

If your site is deployed to www.example.com, then the webhook URL should be `https://www.example.com/api/preview-links?token=secretTokenProtectingWebhookEndpointsFromBeingCalledByAnyone`.

That endpoint URL corresponds to the file [src/routes/api/preview-links/+server.ts](src/routes/api/preview-links/+server.ts) in this repo.

The secret token is defined as the env var `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` in [.env.example](.env.example). If you deployed this starter from our marketplace, its default value will be `secretTokenProtectingWebhookEndpointsFromBeingCalledByAnyone`. If you manually deployed it, you'll have to set that token. It can be any URL-safe string as long as the `PRIVATE_SECRET_API_TOKEN` env var and the `token` query parameter both match.
